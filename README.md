# Instagram-Follower-Bot
You might find this useful if you're trying to grow your Instagram account by following random people in hopes that they like your posted content.
This program is meant to alleviate the time spent by following individual accounts on separate instagram pages.

Uses Selenium to scrape the website and runs the script accordingly.
It will log you into Instagram using the provided credentials, find a pages following, scrolls down on the navigation bar and then follows every person scrolled through.

There's many things that can be improved in this program like adding an unfollow function to the accounts that you have followed to increase your follower/following
ratio or being able to loop through multiple pages on instagram to follow other accounts on as well.

This is my first repository so please have some patience if my code isn't good. If you find anything you would like to contribute or collaborate on please do submit as that is the main purpose for this posting!
